## Phase 6 Experiments (2026-04-01 onwards)

### New Assignments (2026-04-03)

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2086: Phase 6: SAM Phase-Only — Flat Minima for OOD Generalization
- Branch: `frieren/sam-phase-only`
- Student: frieren
- Hypothesis: SAM (already in train.py) applied only in last 25% of training (epoch≥120) finds flatter minima. Sweep rho={0.05, 0.1, 0.2} since Lion's sign updates may need different scaling than Adam. Target: reduce seed variance AND improve p_oodc/p_re.
- 8-GPU: 2 baselines (s42/s43) + 3 rho values × 2 seeds = 8 runs
- Status: WIP — assigned

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2085: Phase 6: srf4L Ensemble Seeds 58-65 (3rd Batch) — nezuko
- Branch: `nezuko/srf4L-ensemble-v3`
- Hypothesis: More srf4L seeds (58-65) to build toward larger ensemble pool
- Status: WIP, 8 runs running

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2083: Phase 6: srf4L Ensemble Seeds 50-57 — fern
- Branch: `fern/srf4L-ensemble-v2`
- Hypothesis: srf4L seeds 50-57 to complement edward's seeds 42-49
- Status: WIP, 8 runs running

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2082: Phase 6: Packed Ensemble — thorfinn
- Branch: `thorfinn/packed-ensemble`
- Hypothesis: M sub-models packed into one forward pass via grouped linear ops. Test M=2,4,8. From Laurent et al. 2023, AirfRANS shows 25% training speedup over deep ensembles.
- 8 GPUs: 2 baseline + 2×M=2 + 2×M=4 + 2×M=8
- Status: WIP, 8 runs running

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2081: Phase 6: srf4L + 8-Seed Ensemble (Compound) — edward
- Branch: `edward/srf4L-ensemble`
- Hypothesis: If srf4L improves individual model quality, ensembling srf4L models should beat the existing ensemble
- 8 GPUs: seeds 42-49 with --surface_refine_layers 4
- Status: WIP, 8 crashed + 8 running (relaunched)

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2080: Phase 6: Ensemble Seeds 66-73 (Building Toward 24-Model) — tanjiro
- Branch: `tanjiro/ensemble-more-seeds`
- Hypothesis: Extend ensemble to 24 models (seeds 42-73). If ensemble variance reduction scales with N, 24-model could give another step down.
- Status: WIP, 8 crashed + 8 running (relaunched)

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2079: Phase 6: srf4L on Asinh Baseline (Multi-Seed) — askeladd
- Branch: `askeladd/srf4L-asinh`
- Hypothesis: Test srf4L (surface_refine_layers=4 vs 3) as a standalone improvement. 4 seeds each config.
- Status: WIP, 8 crashed + 8 running (srf4L-multiseed group)

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2068: Phase 6: Asymmetric/Magnitude-Weighted Surface Loss — alphonse
- Branch: `alphonse/asymmetric-loss`
- Hypothesis: Replace symmetric L1 with magnitude-weighted L1 (overweight stagnation/suction peaks) and pinball tau=0.45 (penalize underprediction)
- 8 GPUs: 2 baseline + magnitude-weighted α=0.5 + α=1.0 + pinball τ=0.45 × 2 seeds each
- Status: WIP, 8 runs running

#### 2026-04-03 — PR #2066: Phase 6: Synthetic Data Generation via Physics-Consistent Interpolation — frieren
- Branch: `frieren/data-gen-interpolation` (CLOSED)
- Hypothesis: Interpolate between same-condition CFD samples to create synthetic training data
- Results: DEAD END. All metrics 3-10x worse than baseline. Root cause: mesh-level interpolation is physically meaningless for unstructured CFD (no spatial correspondence between node indices across different meshes)
- W&B runs: xjo7mj7s, 5dggj8av, ysg5zqr4, nandekgh, jr5qg1i1, s3lt4tjd, 5d828zol, 1n8k5m0g
- Status: CLOSED

### New Assignments (2026-04-02)

#### 2026-04-02 — PR #2008: Phase 6: PirateNets — Random Weight Factorization
- Branch: `frieren/pirate-nets`
- Student: frieren
- Hypothesis: Apply Random Weight Factorization (RWF) from PirateNets to MLP layers. W = diag(exp(s)) * V where V is fixed random, s is learned. Enables multi-scale frequency learning for better boundary layer / pressure prediction.
- 8-GPU sweep: baseline × 2, RWF uniform × 2, RWF multiscale × 2, RWF multiscale + higher LR × 2
- Status: WIP — assigned

#### 2026-04-02 — PR #2009: Phase 6: Geosolver — Geometry-Aware Feature Encoding
- Branch: `alphonse/geosolver`
- Student: alphonse
- Hypothesis: Add explicit geometric features (wall distance, curvature, normals) as inputs + geometry-conditioned attention bias. Physics-geometry coupling directly encoded.
- 8-GPU sweep: baseline × 2, geo features × 2, geo + attention × 2, geo + attn + higher surf_weight × 2
- Status: WIP — assigned

#### 2026-04-02 — PR #2010: Phase 6: HeavyBall Optimizers
- Branch: `nezuko/heavyball-optimizers`
- Student: nezuko
- Hypothesis: Sweep modern optimizers (SOAP, CauchyAdamW, Schedule-Free AdamW, PaLM-SOAP) as alternatives to Lion. Different optimizers handle CFD's extreme gradient structure differently.
- 8-GPU sweep: SOAP × 2 LR, CauchyAdamW × 2 LR, Schedule-Free × 2 LR, PaLM-SOAP, HB-AdamW
- Status: WIP — assigned

#### 2026-04-01 23:25 — PR #2006: Phase 6: Muon Optimizer + Gram-NS
- Branch: `phase6/muon-optimizer`
- Student: thorfinn
- Hypothesis: Replace Lion with Muon (Newton-Schulz orthogonalized gradients).
- **Status: ALL 8 RUNS CRASHED** — zero metrics logged. Code bug. Advisor commented with fix guidance.

#### 2026-04-01 23:25 — PR #2007: Phase 6: XSA (Exclusive Self-Attention)
- Branch: `phase6/xsa-attention`
- Student: askeladd

- **Status: ALL 8 RUNS CRASHED.** Catastrophically bad metrics (val/loss 3.76-10.6 vs baseline 0.383). Code regression. Advisor commented with fix guidance.

  |-----|----------|------|--------|
  | xsa-t0.5-s42 | 3.761 | 296.4 | crashed |
  | baseline-s42 | 3.830 | 299.6 | crashed |

- 50+ Phase 5 experiments explored: throughput optimization, data augmentation, architecture variants, loss formulations, ensemble methods, curriculum learning, distillation
- Most incremental tuning exhausted — motivates Phase 6 shift
