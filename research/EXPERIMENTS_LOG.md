# SENPAI Research Results

## Phase 6 Experiments (2026-04-01 onwards)

### New Assignments (2026-04-02)

#### 2026-04-02 — PR #2008: Phase 6: PirateNets — Random Weight Factorization
- Branch: `frieren/pirate-nets`
- Student: frieren
- Hypothesis: Apply Random Weight Factorization (RWF) from PirateNets to MLP layers. W = diag(exp(s)) * V where V is fixed random, s is learned. Enables multi-scale frequency learning for better boundary layer / pressure prediction.
- 8-GPU sweep: baseline × 2, RWF uniform × 2, RWF multiscale × 2, RWF multiscale + higher LR × 2
- Status: WIP — assigned

#### 2026-04-02 — PR #2009: Phase 6: Geosolver — Geometry-Aware Feature Encoding
- Branch: `alphonse/geosolver`
- Student: alphonse
- Hypothesis: Add explicit geometric features (wall distance, curvature, normals) as inputs + geometry-conditioned attention bias. Physics-geometry coupling directly encoded.
- 8-GPU sweep: baseline × 2, geo features × 2, geo + attention × 2, geo + attn + higher surf_weight × 2
- Status: WIP — assigned

#### 2026-04-02 — PR #2010: Phase 6: HeavyBall Optimizers
- Branch: `nezuko/heavyball-optimizers`
- Student: nezuko
- Hypothesis: Sweep modern optimizers (SOAP, CauchyAdamW, Schedule-Free AdamW, PaLM-SOAP) as alternatives to Lion. Different optimizers handle CFD's extreme gradient structure differently.
- 8-GPU sweep: SOAP × 2 LR, CauchyAdamW × 2 LR, Schedule-Free × 2 LR, PaLM-SOAP, HB-AdamW
- Status: WIP — assigned

### Previously Assigned

#### 2026-04-01 23:25 — PR #2006: Phase 6: Muon Optimizer + Gram-NS
- Branch: `phase6/muon-optimizer`
- Student: thorfinn
- Hypothesis: Replace Lion with Muon (Newton-Schulz orthogonalized gradients).
- **Status: ALL 8 RUNS CRASHED** — zero metrics logged. Code bug. Advisor commented with fix guidance.

#### 2026-04-01 23:25 — PR #2007: Phase 6: XSA (Exclusive Self-Attention)
- Branch: `phase6/xsa-attention`
- Student: askeladd
- Hypothesis: Replace slice attention with XSA exclusion mechanism.
- **Status: ALL 8 RUNS CRASHED.** Catastrophically bad metrics (val/loss 3.76-10.6 vs baseline 0.383). Code regression. Advisor commented with fix guidance.

  | Run | val/loss | p_in | Status |
  |-----|----------|------|--------|
  | xsa-t0.5-s42 | 3.761 | 296.4 | crashed |
  | baseline-s42 | 3.830 | 299.6 | crashed |

## Phase 5 Experiments

### Still Running
- PR #2004: Noise Schedule Sweep (fern) — 8 runs running, no metrics yet
- PR #2003: Warmup & LR Schedule Sweep (edward) — 8 runs running (earlier 8 crashed), no metrics yet
- PR #2001: Learned Per-Channel Loss Weighting (tanjiro) — 8 runs running + 1 crashed debug, no metrics yet

### Closed (Dead Ends)
- PR #1998: Multi-Exit Ensemble (frieren) — **CLOSED.** All 8 crashed, val/loss 4.0-7.5. Auxiliary losses destabilized training.
- PR #2002: EMA Decay Sweep (nezuko) — **CLOSED.** All 8 crashed, val/loss 1.1. Runs terminated too early.
- PR #2000: OOD-Focused Training (alphonse) — **CLOSED.** All 8 crashed, val/loss 4.0-11.5. Hard-mining diverged.

### Winners (Merged — Phase 5)
1. **PR #1927: Residual Prediction** — predict correction from freestream. p_oodc -4.7%, p_tan -1.9%
2. **PR #1935: Surface Refinement Head** — dedicated surface MLP. p_re -72.7%, p_tan -8.9%, val/loss -3.3%

### Key Non-Winners (Closed — Phase 5)
- 50+ Phase 5 experiments explored: throughput optimization, data augmentation, architecture variants, loss formulations, ensemble methods, curriculum learning, distillation
- Most incremental tuning exhausted — motivates Phase 6 shift
